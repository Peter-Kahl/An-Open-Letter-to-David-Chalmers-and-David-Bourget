### Abstract

In this open letter to Professors David Chalmers and David Bourget, I formally address serious fiduciary-epistemic governance failures at PhilPapers, particularly regarding transparency, accountability, and responsiveness. Drawing upon fiduciary theory, epistemic justice principles, and my previous scholarly contributions, I highlight structural conflicts of interest arising from their dual governance and editorial roles. I argue that these governance issues significantly undermine the legitimacy, epistemic fairness, and trustworthiness of PhilPapers as a global scholarly resource. The letter explicitly calls upon Chalmers and Bourget to publicly acknowledge these concerns, commit to immediate governance reforms, and restore epistemic justice and institutional integrity within PhilPapers.
